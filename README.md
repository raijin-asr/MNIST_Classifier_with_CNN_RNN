# MNIST_Classifier_with_CNN_RNN
MNIST Classification with CNN and RNN with some optimizers like AdamW, SGD, RMSProp.

## What is MNIST dataset?
The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of handwritten digits (0-9) that are commonly used for training and testing image classification systems, particularly in machine learning; it stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology" and consists of grayscale images, each 28x28 pixels in size, with a large training set of 60,000 images and a smaller test set of 10,000 images.
